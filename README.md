# FirefoxFacebookLagFix
A fix for the overwhelming CPU/RAM load caused by having Facebook open.  This was accomplished using uBlock Origin 1.14.0 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) and a combination of dynamic filtering rules on Firefox Quantum 57.0b5 (64-bit) (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#beta)
